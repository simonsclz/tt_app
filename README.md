# tt_app - Table Tennis Game Application
A simple application for our table tennis team to have an overview over the upcoming games.

# Purpose

As it is hard to track everybody's game attendance via WhatsApp, it was chosen to build an
online application where each team member is able to check who is going to play.
The website is going to be built with Streamlit, an open-source Python library for developing
online applications.

# How to use

Each team member has a specific username and password.
With this information, it is possible to log in and view the upcoming games and the attendances.
